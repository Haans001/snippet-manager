Configuring Eslint in React project every time from scratch was really annoying, so I created this simple starter in order to save myself some time in the future. 

## ðŸš€ Quick start
1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/Haans001/react-typescript-simple-starter .
```  
2. Run development server.
```
npm start
```
3. Now your app is running at `http://localhost:3000` .
